# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the Subscription Template for Marzban! This project keeps maintenance lightweight while aiming for production-quality code and documentation. The guidelines below help us stay consistent.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) principles even though the full text is not bundled here.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch named after the change you are making (e.g. `docs/update-readme` or `fix/qr-modal-focus`).
3. Ensure you can preview static HTML locally (any web server or browser is fine).

## Development Workflow
- Preview `template/index.html` and `template/index.fa.html` after every change to verify layout and language updates.
- When adding assets, prefer lossless formats and keep file sizes modest.
- Keep translations in sync between English and Persian templates/docs. If you change one, update the other in the same pull request.

## Commit Messages & PRs
- Use conventional-style prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, or `ci:`.
- Keep commits focused; small, logical steps are easier to review.
- Include screenshots or screen recordings when you touch UI elements.
- In your pull request description, explain the motivation, summarize the changes, and mention how you tested them.

## Issue Reporting
When filing an issue, provide:
- The Marzban version in use
- Browser and OS information
- Screenshots of the problem when applicable
- Relevant excerpts from your `.env` or deployment configuration (omit secrets)

We appreciate your helpâ€”thank you for contributing!
